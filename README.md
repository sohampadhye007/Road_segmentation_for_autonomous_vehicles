This repository serves as a Semantic Segmentation Suite. The goal is to easily be able to implement, train, and test new Semantic Segmentation models! Complete with the following: <br> 

Training and testing modes <br>
Data augmentation <br>
Several state-of-the-art models. Easily plug and play with different models
Able to use any dataset <br>
Evaluation including precision, recall, f1 score, average accuracy, per-class accuracy, and mean IoU
Plotting of loss function and accuracy over epochs <br>
